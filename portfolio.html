                <p> In my Application Development II class we had to construct a multi-screen app with navigation, using Kotlin and Jetpack Compose as the languages, and Android Studio as the IDE. 
                   This was my first foray into Provider Pattern navigation and using routing in my application. The basis of the app is to keep track of which Pokemon gyms a player of the first game has
                   defeated. It also displays an image that the user provides with a link from an online source.

                <img src="../Assets/Images/E-Commerce01.JPG">
                <p>This was my final project for my Web Programming III class, where we learned about Microservices architecture and used it to create a E-commerce website that was deployed with
                    Azure and used Docker container as a database. It demonstrated how software can be more scalable, reliable and available using this cutting-edge technology. I had a lot of fun this with
                    this project as it demonstrated all the skills I have learned in my Web Programming III class and the previous web courses.

                    <img src="../Assets/Images/BigBrain01.JPG" >
                    <p>The goal of this project was to create a grocery store inventory-tracking application that uses object-oriented programming and WPF skills taught in Programming III.
                        This project was completed by myself and another classmate as a final project for Programming III. This app was designed to be user-friendly to navigate
                        while allowing the users to add, delete, update any grocery items for their store, while allowing them to save and load CSV files with the input into the app.

                    <img src="../Assets/Images/2020-02.JPG" >
                    <p>The goal of this final project for my Web Programming I course was to demonstrate my knowledge of JavaScript, object-oriented programming, and using Canvas. It's 
                        a webpage based video game where the user navigates a CostCo to retrieve toilet paper while avoiding various enemies that can kill it. The user has a stress level meter 
                        which impedes their speed and the only way to reduce the stress is consuming boxes of wine that are randomly generated throughout the store. This was the first web-based
                        video game I designed and implemented by myself.

                    <img src="../Assets/Images/WonderfulEvents01.JPG" >
                    <p>This was my final project for my Web Programming II class, completed in a team of three. This website, Wonderful Events, is a website that provides users a more efficient way to
                        organize different events, with a colourful and practical user-interface and tracking service. The user inputs information about which guests, songs and meals they want for their
                        event, and also provides CRUD functionality. The website uses Docker as a database to store the data input from the user, and the user can make a website account to create and retrieve
                        information about specific events they have planned. The website can be used in either French or English languages.
